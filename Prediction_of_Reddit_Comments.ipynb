        "\n",
        "In this project, we practiced some essential skills:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Collecting data by scraping a website using the Python package `requests` and using the Python library `BeautifulSoup` which efficiently extracts HTML code. We scraped the 'hot' threads as listed on the [Reddit homepage](https://www.reddit.com/) and acquired the following pieces of information about each thread:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The title of the thread\n",
        "   - subreddit that the thread corresponds to\n",
        "   - The length of time it has been up on Reddit\n",
        "   - The number of comments on the thread\n",
        "\n",
        "- Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the data. NLP, in a nutshell, is \"how to transform text data and convert it to features that enable us to build models.\" These techniques include:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Tokenization (splitting text into pieces based on given patterns)\n",
        "    - Removing stopwords\n",
        "    - Stemming (returns the base form of the word)\n",
        "    - Lemmatization (return the word's *lemma*)\n",
        "\n",
        "- After the step above we obtain *numerical* features which allow for algebraic computations. We then build a `RandomForestClassifier` and use it to classify each post according to the corresponding number of comments associated with it. More concretely the model predicts whether or not a given Reddit post will have above or below the _median_ number of comments."

        "\n",
        "1) The accuracy score is quite low, just slighly higher than the baseline when only the subreddits are considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) With the parameters ranges in the `GridSearchCV` fixed, including words in the threads in addition to only subreddits dummies in the set of predictors increased the accuracy of the model compared with the case where only the latter was used, but only slighly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) The most significant gain came when we included a new hyperparameter, namely, `'min_samples_split` in the model and kept threads' words and subredddits as predictors. The accuracy in this case was close to 0.7.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) The most common words in the threads are 'get','like' and 'love'.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) The most important features in our best model were 'game', 'guy', both from the threads.\n",
        "\n",
        "6) In a nutshell our best model was obtained considering both subredddits as dummies and words on the threads and keeping `max_depth`,`min_samples_split` and `n_estimators` as parameters to be scanned by the `GridSearchCV`\n",
        "\n",
        "7) The obvious next step is to increase the number of scraped pages. Because our data was limited, we could not set a minimum frequency to the words. Taking only words that occur more frequently can help."
